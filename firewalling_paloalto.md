# Firewalling on Palo Alto Firewalls
## Terms
*PAN-OS*: Palo Alto Networksâ€™ own operating system for their virtual and physical firewalls.  Based on CentOS, the operating system allows for users to enter a configure mode to change firewall settings with a limited set of commands and possible actions.

*Virtual Wire*: An ability of PAs that allows them to appear invisible on the network but still scan and apply rules to traffic as it passes through the firewall.

*Layer3*: A generic configuration of a port that allows it to gain an IP address.  Generally used for normal firewall operations such as traffic management and DHCP.

*Wildfire*: PAs ability to capture unknown files/EXEs to test what they do in a virtual environment and block them in the future.  Requires communication with the Palo Alto Cloud- tests are not done locally.

## Configuration Notes
When setting up a Palo, the first work that needs to be done is securing/configuring the management interface.  This is usually done via command line by console connection.  Set a static ip and get into the web portal.  It is important to make sure you have a secure user and restrict access to only certain types of communication (ssh, https).  After you give it a static ip, you can access the management interface.

After getting your management interface set up and making sure you have access to the web portal, updates should be done to make sure your box is up to date.  Update the OS then the anti-malware package and set up to auto check and update.  To do this you need to let your management interface access the internet.

Once you are updated, set up your other interfaces appropriatly.  You generally want to do either a virtual wire or a layer3 interface.  Virtual wires act as a passthrough for traffic and just apply firewall rules.  Layer3 makes the ports have an IP address and act as a hop when going to or from a machine.  Virtual wires are good for applying rules without others knowing you're there while layer3 interfaces are better for more traditional firewalling.  After configuring interfaces, add your interfaces to zones, generally "inside" and "outside" are used.  There are commonly used in rules to specify traffic direction instead of using unique interfaces.

## Rules
Firewalls get their primary functionality from rules.  These rules monitor what goes through the firewall and applies filters to change how things pass through.  Palo Alto's do this with a rulebase.  The rulebase has a series of different rule types depending on how the traffic should be handled.  The two most common ones are the Security and NAT rulebases.  The Security rulebase is used for general firewall security rules and checks packets as they pass.  The NAT rulebase is used for applying NAT filters to traffic as is passes through.

To make a rule, you need to specify what the rule criteria is.  This is generally determined by applications or services.  Applications are generally predefined by Palo Alto and have strict criteria for filtering and understanding the traffic.  Examples include google-docs, youtube, active-directory, etc.  You can also create your own applications.  Services are more broad and only care about protocol and port.

Palo's also get their strength from their anti- detection.  You can apply this through a security profile which has a few smaller security types.  These include anti-virus, anti-spyware, dos protection, etc.  It is easiest to set each of these up individually and put then on one profile-group to apply to all of your rules.

After you have criteria and security setting ready, you can make rules in the rulebase.  The safest way to it is by whitelisting, or by default blocking everything and allowing in only what you need.  Rules are executed top down.  Make sure to specify to/from as a zone and source/destination as IP addresses or ranges of IPs.  Select specific applications and/or services to apply to and ALWAYS select your security profile.  Finally, pick your action on the final tab (allow, deny, and drop are most common).
